Simple Todo React app, uses localstorage to store the TODOS.

Try it out :

Features are which allow you to :

Create,
Read (if you can),
Update,
Delete.

You can mark them completed by clicking the âœ… icon. They will go the completed Todos Stack. From there you can delete them only.

Top right yellow button thingy clears everything even from localstorage.

# BEST FEATURE

YOU CAN DRAG THE ACTIVE TODOS AND PRIORITIZE THEM OR PROCRASTINATE. SHUFFLE THE LIST TO YOUR COMFORT. COOLEST THING I LEARNED THIS PROJECT. IT WORKS FINE AF BTW.
THEME IS DARK, thank me for saving your eyes.

Let me know for any Errors or improvement or suggestions.

HAPPY CODING
